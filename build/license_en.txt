TERMS OF USE AND SOFTWARE LICENSE AGREEMENT

Please read these Terms of Use and Software License Agreement (the “Agreement”) carefully before installing the Go.Data Software (the “Software”).

By installing and/or using the Software, you (the “Licensee”) enter into an agreement with the World Health Organization (“WHO”) and you accept all terms, conditions, and requirements of the Agreement.

 

1. Components of the Software
1.1. The Software is a product developed by WHO (the “Software”) and enables you to input, upload and view your data (the “Data”).

This Agreement governs your use of the Software you have downloaded

 
2. Third-party software
2.1. Third-party software embedded in the Software.  The Software utilizes third party open source software, issued under multiple license types (including Artistic 2.0, Apache 2.0, the “GNU Affero GPL version 3”, BSD (3 clause), ISC, WTFPL and the “MIT license”) (the “Third Party Components”) which are embedded within the Software.

2.2. WHO disclaimers for third-party software. WHO makes no warranties whatsoever, and specifically disclaims any and all warranties, express or implied, that either of the Third Party Components are free of defects, virus free, able to operate on an uninterrupted basis, merchantable, fit for a particular purpose, accurate, non-infringing or appropriate for your technical system.  
[2.3.  Other third-party software.  To the extent you are required to enter into a user license in order to use the Software, WHO is not a party to any such license, and WHO therefore disclaims all liability, responsibility, and/or involvement with any such license. WHO shall not be held liable or responsible for either any breach of any of the terms and conditions of such user licenses entered by you, or any damages arising from your use of such user licenses].
2.4. No WHO endorsement of third-party software.  The use of the Third Party Components or other third-party software does not imply that these products are endorsed or recommended by WHO in preference to others of a similar nature.
 

3. License and Terms of Use for the Software
3.1. Copyright and license. The Software is copyright (©) World Health Organization, 2018, and is distributed under the terms of the GNU Affero General Public License (GPL), version 3.  As stated in the source code for the Software, the Software incorporates or makes reference to the Third Party Components, and WHO issues the Software under GNU Affero GPL “version 3” in part to comply with the terms of those software. WHO disclaims any responsibility or liability with respect to the use or completeness of such license.

 

4. Copyright, Disclaimer and Terms of Use for the Maps
4.1. The boundaries and names shown and the designations used on the maps [embedded in the Software] (the “Maps”) do not imply the expression of any opinion whatsoever on the part of WHO concerning the legal status of any country, territory, city or area or of its authorities, or concerning the delimitation of its frontiers or boundaries. Dotted and dashed lines on maps represent approximate border lines for which there may not yet be full agreement.

4.2. Unlike the Software, WHO is not publishing the Maps under the GNU Affero GPL. The Maps are not based on “R”, they are an independent and separate work from the Software, and is not distributed as “part of a whole” with the Software, as those terms and concepts are used in the GPL.

5.1. Retained Rights. Except as otherwise indicated herein, WHO owns and shall retain all right, title and interest in and to the Software, including all intellectual property rights embodied therein, including (i) all of the service marks, trademarks, trade names or any other designations associated with the Software; and (ii) all copyrights, patent rights, trade secret rights, and other proprietary rights relating to the Software. Nothing contained in this License shall be deemed to convey to the Licensee any title or ownership in the Software or the related documentation.

All requests to use the WHO name and/or emblem require advance written approval of WHO.

 

7. Disclaimers by WHO
7.1. No WHO warranties.  WHO makes no warranty with respect to the Software, and disclaims all statutory or implied warranties, expressed or implied, as to the accuracy, completeness or usefulness of any information, apparatus, product, or process related to the Software, including, without limitation, to any warranty of design or fitness for a particular purpose, even if WHO has been informed of such purpose.
